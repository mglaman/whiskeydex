# Whiskey Dex

Because I want a way to track my whiskey collection and whiskey I have tasted and want to get a bottle of!


## Hosting

Currently trying out [Render](https://render.com) and deploying on their free tier: https://whiskeydex.onrender.com (Docker web service, PostgreSQL.)

## PHPUnit + code coverage

PHPUnit is setup to calculate code coverage for the custom module.

## PHPCS

Customized PHPCS.

Stuck using `@phpstan-` prefixes for params and returns until drupal/coder is updated.
